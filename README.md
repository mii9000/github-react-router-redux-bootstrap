## ES6+ Features
- async await - Used to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete e.g. `fetch` without making use of callbacks with `Promise.then`. This makes the code look synchronous and increases readability.
- Arrow Functions - Used to capture the expected context of `this`, get rid of binding in Component constructors and also more concise than writing `function` everytime
- Spread Operator - Used to clone objects to help with immutability and to deconstruct object properties into multiple assignments
